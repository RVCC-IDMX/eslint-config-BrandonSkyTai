# ESLint Config Assignment
## Let's Learn an ESLint Rule

An important rule for ESLint are the semi rule and ASI. They are important in JavaScript because they help ensure the proper functioning and readability of the code. The semi rule enforces the use of semicolons and helps to prevent syntax errors, while ASI provides a safety net for people who may forget to add semicolons. However, it's important to understand the limitations of ASI and to use semicolons consistently to avoid potential bugs.
